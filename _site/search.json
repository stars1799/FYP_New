With a decrease in children and young adults, a steady increase in the elderly population, and a decline in the middle-aged population over the past decade. In terms of age group distribution in AMK, the highest population is in the age group 55-59, while the lowest is in the age group 85 and over. \nIn the age group trend of the nested group, the graph suggests a decreasing trend in the combined population of children and young adults, while the combined population of middle-aged and elderly individuals shows a slight increase with some fluctuations over the years. Generally, the male and female populations tend to be comparable, but there are a few age groups where one gender may slightly outnumber the other. The gender distribution appears relatively balanced in the younger age groups. As individuals age, the gender ratio may exhibit some variations, but in general, there is no significant skew toward one gender. In the older age groups, there is a trend of more females than males, especially in the 85 and over category.\n\n\n\nBased on the Age Group Trend chart in Punggol, there has been a notable change in the demographic composition across age groups in Punggol over the past decade with significant increases across all age groups over the past decade, suggesting a transformation in the demographic composition of the area. The highest population is in the age group 35-39 with 199,160 individuals, followed by the age group 30-34, with a total of 182,410 individuals. These age groups represent the peak working-age population. Overall, the chart indicates a substantial working-age population and a decreasing trend in older age groups. \nIn the nested chart, both groups, “Child + Young Adults” and “Middle Aged + Elderly,” experience significant population growth over the years, indicating demographic changes in these age categories. The overall trend indicates an increasing population in Punggol, with both younger and older age groups contributing to this growth. Lastly, the data suggests a generally balanced gender distribution across age groups, with some variations in specific age brackets. In the working-age groups, there are variations, with some age groups having more females (25-34), and others having more males (40-49)."

It also showcases the spread of our data for both population density and desire lines respectively in the form of a box-and-whiskers graph. Selecting the area on either map would allow the user to see the exact values for desire lines and poulation density on the box-and-whiskers graph.\n\n\nRelationship Dashboard\nThe second dashboard showcases the relationship between our desire lines and 3 different variables - population density, area size and population respectively. Based on the Population Density & Desire Lines chart, although there is a upward trend observed, the p-value of this trend line is at 0.13. This means that the trend is not statically significant, indicating that there is no real relationship between Population Density & Desire Lines.\nAs such, we would explore with the other variables to see if they have a statically significant relationship with desire lines. Firstly, based on the Area Size & Desire Lines chart, we noticed that there is an upward trend as well. However, plotting the trend line once again gives us a p-value of 0.27 which also implies that this trend is not statically significant, indicating that there is no real relationship between Area Size & Desire Lines.\nLastly, based on the Population & Desire Lines chart, we observe that there is an upward trend as well. However, plotting the trend line this time gives us a significant p-value of only 0.007. This means that, with our alpha at 0.05, this trend is statically significant, indicating that there is a real relationship between Population & Desire Lines."

A trend line plotted has a p-value of <0.0001 which signifies that there is a real relationship between average household size and the total number of households. This is further supported by the line chart where we can see that over the years from 1981-2022 there is an increase in total number of households while the average household size, reflected by the colour of the line, becomes lighter, which implies that it is decreasing over the years."

    "text": "In urban development, there is a significant challenge of conceptual designs being laid out by architects and urban planners that do not always align with the practical needs and preferences of people who use these spaces. After the implementation of these designs, it often becomes evident that there is a gap between the envisioned plans and the community’s practical needs, which should truly align with their desires for accessibility. This gap then results in “desired lines” which are natural walkways or routes that people prefer to take when moving between locations. These pathways are not originally implemented but emerge organically based on their needs and preferences.\nWith limited land and space to work with in Singapore, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore (URA) aims to bridge this gap by developing a framework that they can use to prevent the need for retrofitting. Additionally, with future estates in consideration, URA aims to effectively build an estate with more direct and accessible paths from HDB estates to key amenities.\n\n\n\nOur project aims to bridge this gap by reevaluating an existing estate with these desired lines and developing a comprehensive framework that eliminates the need for such pathways. The framework will be one that URA will ultimately leverage and follow to plan for future estates that contain more direct paths to key amenities. Through this project, we are committed to rearranging the urban environment through a user-centric perspective that optimally accommodates the community’s movements, thus eliminating the disconnect between conceptual designs and practical needs.\nAdditionally, we recognise that retrofitting is difficult. Therefore, our focus is on preemptively eliminating the need for retrofitting by ensuring that the initial designs of walkways are in harmony with the community’s needs. This proactive strategy not only saves resources but also creates convenience for residents to travel to and from key amenities.\n\n\n\nThe project aligns with the goal of creating an inclusive and accessible urban environment within the Smart City Framework. Our project aims to enhance accessibility for everyone within the city by ensuring that urban spaces are designed to truly accommodate the needs of pedestrians. By studying how people navigate their surroundings, we gain valuable insights into their practical needs and desired walkways. This in-depth analysis allows us to design urban spaces that organically align with the way residents move, eliminating the disconnect between conceptual designs and real-life requirements. We believe that this would improve the well-being of the community as they would be able to navigate the urban landscape more comfortably and safely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsor\nURA - Ms Tan Chun Xiao (Planner under Design & Planning Lab) \n\n\nUsers\nURA and the Design & Planning Lab team\n\n\nAdvisors/Practitioners/Mentors\nURA - Mr Wang Songyu \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA framework with a set of methodologies that details how URA can build future walkways and BFAs in estates, providing desired walkways that people are looking for within their estate to access key amenities efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\nURA are able to conduct data-informed urban planning when planning for walkways around the HDBs and key amenities within the estate.\nReduces the need to retrofit future walkways in estates to correct errors which saves time and resources.\nMore efficient use of untapped land in Singapore, given the limited amount of land available.\n\n\n\n\nThe scope of this project centres around the main tasks that we will need to perform:\n\nAnalysis of current locations of HDB buildings and amenities within the chosen estates\nAnalysis of current walking routes between the postal codes within the estate (especially between the amenities and HDBs)\nAnalyse the current considerations (framework) used when planning a HDB estate\nAnalyse population demographics (Singstat data) and gain insights into their behaviours when travelling within the estate (behavioural analysis)\nGenerate a new framework to be used when planning the layout of a new estate for building walkways"

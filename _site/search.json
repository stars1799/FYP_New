    "text": "EDA\n\nDataset: Type of Dwelling Data 19-01-2024 (Ver 1.0)\n\nChi Square Test\n\nUsed for:\n\nPlanning Area and Age Group - AMK\nPlanning Area and Age Group - Punggol\nDwelling Type and Age Group in Planning Area (AMK)\nDwelling Type and Age Group in Planning Area (Punggol)\n\nWhy it was chosen:\n\nCategorical Variables: Planning Area, Age Group and Dwelling Type are categorical variables. Planning Area represents different areas in Singapore, Age Group categorises individuals into different age ranges, while Dwelling Type categorises the different types of flats.\nIndependence Testing: The chi-square test assesses whether there is a significant association or independence between the selected categorical variables. One example would be, it helps determine whether there is a relationship between the Planning Area and Age Group categories or if they are independent of each other.\n\nAn example of the result:\n\n\nCorrelation Heatmap\n\nUsed for:\n\nBased on Type of Dwelling - AMK\nBased on Type of Dwelling - Punggol\nBased on Type of Dwelling - AMK & Punggol\n\nWhy it was chosen:\n\nMixed Data Types: The dataset contains a mix of numerical data (‘Total Number of Households in 2023’) and categorical data (‘Type of Dwelling’). A correlation heatmap is suitable for assessing relationships between these types of variables.\nUnderstanding Relationships: The goal is likely to understand how different types of dwellings are related to the total number of households. A correlation heatmap visually display the strength and direction of these relationships, helping to identify patterns.\nIdentifying Correlations: The heatmap helps in identifying which types of dwellings show a significant positive or negative correlation with the total number of households. This is crucial for understanding housing patterns in ‘Ang Mo Kio’ (or other planning areas).\nInsights into Housing Trends: The correlation heatmap is likely used to gain insights into housing trends in ‘Ang Mo Kio’ (or other planning areas). For example, it may reveal whether certain types of dwellings are associated with larger or smaller numbers of households.\n\nAn example of the result:\n\n\nLinear - One Hot Encoded Set\n\nUsed for:\n\nAll features\n\nWhy it was chosen:\n\nContinuous Target Variable: Regression models are well-suited for predicting continuous target variables. In this case, the target variable is the “Total Number of Households in 2023,” which is a continuous numerical variable.\nLinear Relationship: Regression models assume a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. If the relationship between the features and the total number of households is approximately linear, a regression model can effectively capture and represent this relationship.\nFeature Importance: It allows for the identification of significant features. The coefficients associated with each feature help in understanding how changes in a particular feature affect the predicted total number of households.\n\nAn example of the result:\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset: Total Type of Dwelling Data 20-01-2024 (Ver 1.0)\n\nCorrelation Heatmap\n\nUsed for:\n\nBased on Subzones - AMK\nBased on Subzones - Punggol\n\nWhy it was chosen:\n\nMultiple Variables: The dataset involves multiple subzones, and a correlation heatmap efficiently displays the correlation coefficients for each pair of subzones with the target variable (“Number of Households in 2023”). \nStrength and Direction of Relationships: The heatmap can not only show the presence of a relationship but also indicates the strength and direction of the correlation. This provides insights into which subzones are positively or negatively associated with the total number of households.\nComparative Analysis: It allows for a quick comparison between different subzones. Thus, one can easily identify which areas have a stronger or weaker relationship with the total number of households, aiding in decision-making or further investigation.\n\nAn example of the result:\n\n\nKDE for NORMALISED age distribution in Planning Area - Subzones\n\nUsed for:\n\nDistribution of number of households in Punggol\nDistribution of number of households in Ang Mo Kio\n\nWhy it was chosen:\n\nCompare multiple subzones: The plots allow easy comparison of age distribution patterns across different subzones within each planning area. This helps identify similarities and differences. Ultimately, I was thinking along the lines of let us try to look at the Subzone that most resembles the total distribution(make up) of the specific Planning Area. \nNormalise values: Calculating the density (share of total households) rather than raw counts normalises the data across subzones of different sizes. This facilitates comparison.\nOverlay lines on same plot: Plotting the data for multiple subzones together on the same axes enables visual evaluation of relative peaks and troughs across age groups.\nLine plot is intuitive: The line plot format provides an intuitive and clear way to visualise trends in household distribution by age. No need for advanced chart knowledge to interpret patterns.\n\nAn example of the result:\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset: Household Data 29-01-2024 (Ver 1.0)\n\nCorrelation Heatmap\n\nUsed for:\n\nAll features \n\nWhy it was chosen:\n\nMultiple Variables: The dataset involves mainly two types of features (number of households that contain a certain number of people and the average number of people living in different types of dwellings), therefore a correlation heatmap aids in displaying any relationships between the two types of features. \nStrength and Direction of Relationships: The heatmap can identify the presence of a relationship and also the strength and direction of said correlation. This would greatly help to provide insights into any relationship between the two features, which could warrant further investigation into said relationship.  \nCorrelation Analysis: It allows for a quick comparison between the average number of people in the varying HDB flats as well as the number of households that contain a certain number of people. This would greatly allow one to identify any relationship between the two types of features that might prompt further analysis for the team.\n\nAn example of the result:\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset: Age Grp, Gender, Race Data 29-01-2024 (Ver 1.0)\n\nPopulation Pyramid\n\nUsed for:\n\nTotal Male Residents\nTotal Female Residents \n\nWhy it was chosen:\n\nTwo Variables: The dataset involves the change in population for males and females from 1957 to 2023 so a Population Pyramid would be suitable to compare and contrast the population of the genders over the years. \nShowcasing Trends: The Pyramid can clearly showcase the overall population growth trend over the years while also showing the differences in population between both genders at a glance. \nPopulation Analysis: It allows us to recognise the overall trend both in the general population as well as with both genders so we can determine if this trend would persist with the inclusion of another feature like age or race. \n\nAn example of the result:\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset: Specific Age Data 29-01-2024 (Ver 1.0).csv\n\nPercentage Change Line Chart\n\nUsed for:\n\nBased on the age data for Singapore Residents  \n\nWhy it was chosen:\n\nMultiple Variables: The dataset contains the age group data of the population from 1957 to 2023 so this line chart allows one to compare and contrast between the percentage changes of different age groups over the years.\nShowcasing Changes: The chart clearly displays any significant change in population for a specific age group over the years and this allows us to gain insights from the data. \nPopulation Analysis: It allows us to recognise significant changes in the population structure of Singapore and narrow down specific demographics that might require further analysis. \n\nAn example of the result:\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset: Age Group and Dwelling 29-01-2024 (Ver 1.0)\n\nStacked Bar Chart\n\nUsed for:\n\nAll features  \n\nWhy it was chosen:\n\nMultiple Variables: The dataset contains the age group dwelling type data of the population from 1957 to 2023 so this stacked bar chart would allow us to compare and contrast the dwelling data for different age groups over the years.\nShowcasing Changes: The chart clearly displays differences in dwelling type for different age groups through the years as well as the total number of residents in that age group in that year. \nDwelling Type Analysis: It allows notice shifts in dwelling type for a specific age group over the years, which could help us gather insights for further analysis. \n\nAn example of the result:\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset: Added Household Data 20-01-2024 (Ver 1.0)\n\nBar Chart/Stacked Bar Charts\n\nUsed for:\n\nDisplaying the number of households in a straightforward manner, where different levels of details are captured (less, for bar chart, more for stacked bar chart)\n\nWhy it was chosen:\n\nCompare multiple groups: The bar plot allows for an effective visual comparison of the new household figures across multiple sub-zones within two separate planning areas. This helps identify patterns and outliers.\nShowcase trend at sub-zone level: Aggregating and plotting the data at the sub-zone level provides a more granular view of projections, beyond just looking at overall planning area figures. It reveals intra-area differences. Similarly, different types of dwelling added can be fairly interesting, especially if we compare within a time period.\nIdentify high growth/decline areas: The visualised data immediately highlights which specific sub-zones saw major increase. \n\nBoth results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset: Yearly Population Data 24-01-2024 (Ver 1.0)\n\nCorrelation Heatmap\n\nUsed for:\n\nChecking strength of correlations across the number of variables less the following variables: Total Population (Number), Resident Population (Number), Singapore Citizen Population (Number), Permanent Resident Population (Number), Non-Resident Population (Number) across the datasets \n\nWhy it was chosen:\n\nFocus on potentially insightful ratios: Ratios like share of citizens, PRs etc. provide normalised perspectives that can reveal new insights compared to raw numbers. These were prioritised for initial exploratory analysis.\nAllow comparisons across many pairs simultaneously: A heatmap allows visually scanning all variable relationships at once, rather than testing correlations one pair at a time. This facilitates identification of overall patterns.\n\nAn example of the result:\n\nHere, to cut the noise: Only strong correlations +->0.70 are shown, and excludes ‘counting itself’ which explains the masked boxes in the correlation heatmap."

In addition, areas with a higher occurrence of desired lines are typically found below HDB blocks as shown in the map. Through our on-the-ground scouting, we’ve noted that many of these designated lines lead to playgrounds, exercise corners, or roundabouts.\nThis method of visual representation helped us to easily pinpoint and showcase the areas that have a heightened potential for desired line occurrences. This allows us to also direct more attention to these specific locations, enabling a more focused investigation into preventive measures aimed at mitigating the emergence of desired lines."

This is further supported by the network analysis of Punggol and our subsequent on-the-ground research in selected subzones in Punggol.\nHowever, other key amenities (i.e. polyclinics, supermarkets, and parks) are relatively more accessible, and there are sufficient supermarkets that cover residential areas within a 5 minute walking time. Elderly people who needs frequent healthcare checkups wouldn’t need to worry about a lack of polyclinics, as the walkways in the area facilitates more direct access to polyclinics."

We asked the question: for each key amenity, how many residential buildings are within 10 minutes walking time, and what proportion of those residential blocks are within a walking time of 5 minutes? Network analysis on were conducted on these key amenities:\n\nFood places (i.e. hawker centres)\nHealthcare facilities (i.e. polyclinics)\nParks\nSupermarkets (e.g. NTUC Fairprice, Sheng Siong, etc)\n\nThese 4 categories of amenities are prioritized for URA’s Land Use planning. Therefore, we utilized OpenStreetMap data to retrieve GIS road layers (i.e. walkable paths in Singapore), locations of key amenities, & locations of residential buildings to conduct this analysis. We then utilized the Iso-Area as Polygon algorithm from the QGIS Network Analysis Toolbox 3 (QNEAT3) library to generate the polygons. The critical parameters for the algorithm were set as follows:\n\nSelecting the paths that are walkable in the Vector layer representing network\nStart Points: For each category of key amenities, select 1 at random, which will be the start point of the polygon\nSize of Iso-Area: Time-based. For this project, we are study walking times of up to 10 minutes, which is equal to 600 seconds.\nContour Interval: Time-based. For the purpose of our analysis, we are using time intervals of 2.5 mins, which is equal to 150 seconds.\nPath type to calculate: Fastest Path (time optimization).\nSetting the Default Speed as 4.44km/h, which is the average walking speed of Singaporeans.\nThe rest of the parameters are left as their default values.\n\nFor each category of amenities, we ran the algorithm for a total of 5 times, with the amenities chosen at random as start points for each iteration of the algorithm. This was done to investigate the accessibility of hawker centres in general and to ensure consistency in our network analysis. To further ensure consistency, each hawker centre were chosen as far apart from each other as possible, without any prior knowledge of its surrounding buildings, where is it situated, and its proximity to other residential buildings.\nFrom the network analysis, hawker centres in Ang Mo Kio cover a sufficient amount of residential buildings within a 5 minutes walking time. In our first example, this can be seen by the total number of residential buildings that are within the 2 innermost polygons, which is a total of 13 residential buildings. Repeated iterations of the algorithm showed similar results, which implied that most residents living in Ang Mo Kio will have little trouble finding eateries in their neighborhood. However, it is likely that the walking speed of most elderly people is slower than the average of 4.44km/h, which means that there are lesser residential areas that can be covered by food centres within a 5 minutes walking time. When considering Ang Mo Kio is geographically hilly in nature and has an aging population, it exacerbates the problem for the elderly in the area. Similar results can also be seen with supermarkets, parks, and polyclinics in Ang Mo Kio."

With a decrease in children and young adults, a steady increase in the elderly population, and a decline in the middle-aged population over the past decade. In terms of age group distribution in AMK, the highest population is in the age group 55-59, while the lowest is in the age group 85 and over. \nIn the age group trend of the nested group, the graph suggests a decreasing trend in the combined population of children and young adults, while the combined population of middle-aged and elderly individuals shows a slight increase with some fluctuations over the years. Generally, the male and female populations tend to be comparable, but there are a few age groups where one gender may slightly outnumber the other. The gender distribution appears relatively balanced in the younger age groups. As individuals age, the gender ratio may exhibit some variations, but in general, there is no significant skew toward one gender. In the older age groups, there is a trend of more females than males, especially in the 85 and over category.\n\n\n\nBased on the Age Group Trend chart in Punggol, there has been a notable change in the demographic composition across age groups in Punggol over the past decade with significant increases across all age groups over the past decade, suggesting a transformation in the demographic composition of the area. The highest population is in the age group 35-39 with 199,160 individuals, followed by the age group 30-34, with a total of 182,410 individuals. These age groups represent the peak working-age population. Overall, the chart indicates a substantial working-age population and a decreasing trend in older age groups. \nIn the nested chart, both groups, “Child + Young Adults” and “Middle Aged + Elderly,” experience significant population growth over the years, indicating demographic changes in these age categories. The overall trend indicates an increasing population in Punggol, with both younger and older age groups contributing to this growth. Lastly, the data suggests a generally balanced gender distribution across age groups, with some variations in specific age brackets. In the working-age groups, there are variations, with some age groups having more females (25-34), and others having more males (40-49)."

Based on the Population Density & Desire Lines chart, although there is a upward trend observed, the p-value of this trend line is at 0.13. This means that the trend is not statically significant, indicating that there is no real relationship between Population Density & Desire Lines.\nAs such, we would explore with the other variables to see if they have a statically significant relationship with desire lines. Firstly, based on the Area Size & Desire Lines chart, we noticed that there is an upward trend as well. However, plotting the trend line once again gives us a p-value of 0.27 which also implies that this trend is not statically significant, indicating that there is no real relationship between Area Size & Desire Lines.\nLastly, based on the Population & Desire Lines chart, we observe that there is an upward trend as well. However, plotting the trend line this time gives us a significant p-value of only 0.007. This means that, with our alpha at 0.05, this trend is statically significant, indicating that there is a real relationship between Population & Desire Lines."

    "text": "In urban development, there is a significant challenge of conceptual designs being laid out by architects and urban planners that do not always align with the practical needs and preferences of people who use these spaces. After the implementation of these designs, it often becomes evident that there is a gap between the envisioned plans and the community’s practical needs, which should truly align with their desires for accessibility. This gap then results in “desired lines” which are natural walkways or routes that people prefer to take when moving between locations. These pathways are not originally implemented but emerge organically based on their needs and preferences.\nWith limited land and space to work with in Singapore, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore (URA) aims to bridge this gap by developing a framework that they can use to prevent the need for retrofitting. Additionally, with future estates in consideration, URA aims to effectively build an estate with more direct and accessible paths from HDB estates to key amenities.\n\n\n\nOur project aims to bridge this gap by reevaluating an existing estate with these desired lines and developing a comprehensive framework that eliminates the need for such pathways. The framework will be one that URA will ultimately leverage and follow to plan for future estates that contain more direct paths to key amenities. Through this project, we are committed to rearranging the urban environment through a user-centric perspective that optimally accommodates the community’s movements, thus eliminating the disconnect between conceptual designs and practical needs.\nAdditionally, we recognise that retrofitting is difficult. Therefore, our focus is on preemptively eliminating the need for retrofitting by ensuring that the initial designs of walkways are in harmony with the community’s needs. This proactive strategy not only saves resources but also creates convenience for residents to travel to and from key amenities.\n\n\n\nThe project aligns with the goal of creating an inclusive and accessible urban environment within the Smart City Framework. Our project aims to enhance accessibility for everyone within the city by ensuring that urban spaces are designed to truly accommodate the needs of pedestrians. By studying how people navigate their surroundings, we gain valuable insights into their practical needs and desired walkways. This in-depth analysis allows us to design urban spaces that organically align with the way residents move, eliminating the disconnect between conceptual designs and real-life requirements. We believe that this would improve the well-being of the community as they would be able to navigate the urban landscape more comfortably and safely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsor\nURA - Ms Tan Chun Xiao (Planner under Design & Planning Lab) \n\n\nUsers\nURA and the Design & Planning Lab team\n\n\nAdvisors/Practitioners/Mentors\nURA - Mr Wang Songyu \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA framework with a set of methodologies that details how URA can build future walkways and BFAs in estates, providing desired walkways that people are looking for within their estate to access key amenities efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\nURA are able to conduct data-informed urban planning when planning for walkways around the HDBs and key amenities within the estate.\nReduces the need to retrofit future walkways in estates to correct errors which saves time and resources.\nMore efficient use of untapped land in Singapore, given the limited amount of land available.\n\n\n\n\nThe scope of this project centres around the main tasks that we will need to perform:\n\nAnalysis of current locations of HDB buildings and amenities within the chosen estates\nAnalysis of current walking routes between the postal codes within the estate (especially between the amenities and HDBs)\nAnalyse the current considerations (framework) used when planning a HDB estate\nAnalyse population demographics (Singstat data) and gain insights into their behaviours when travelling within the estate (behavioural analysis)\nGenerate a new framework to be used when planning the layout of a new estate for building walkways"

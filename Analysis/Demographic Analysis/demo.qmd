## Hypotheses 1 & 2

1.  Has there been a change in the demographic composition across age groups in Ang Mo Kio over the past decade?

2.  Has there been a change in the demographic composition across age groups in Punggol over the past decade?

## Purpose of Dashboard

This dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive overview by looking at factors such as age groups, gender, years etc for each area respectively.

#### Ang Mo Kio Dashboard

Overall, the trends suggest a shift in the demographic composition across age groups of child, middle aged and young adults in Ang Mo Kio. With a decrease in children and young adults, a steady increase in the elderly population, and a decline in the middle-aged population over the past decade. In terms of age group distribution in AMK, the highest population is in the age group 55-59, while the lowest is in the age group 85 and over. 

In the age group trend of the nested group, the graph suggests a decreasing trend in the combined population of children and young adults, while the combined population of middle-aged and elderly individuals shows a slight increase with some fluctuations over the years. Generally, the male and female populations tend to be comparable, but there are a few age groups where one gender may slightly outnumber the other. The gender distribution appears relatively balanced in the younger age groups. As individuals age, the gender ratio may exhibit some variations, but in general, there is no significant skew toward one gender. In the older age groups, there is a trend of more females than males, especially in the 85 and over category.

#### Punggol Dashboard

Based on the Age Group Trend chart in Punggol, there has been a notable change in the demographic composition across age groups in Punggol over the past decade with significant increases across all age groups over the past decade, suggesting a transformation in the demographic composition of the area. The highest population is in the age group 30-34, with a total of 182,410 individuals, followed by the age group 35-39 with 199,160 individuals. These age groups represent the peak working-age population. Overall, the chart indicates a substantial working-age population and a decreasing trend in older age groups. 

In the nested chart, both groups, "Child + Young Adults" and "Middle Aged + Elderly," experience significant population growth over the years, indicating demographic changes in these age categories. The overall trend indicates an increasing population in Punggol, with both younger and older age groups contributing to this growth. Lastly, the data suggests a generally balanced gender distribution across age groups, with some variations in specific age brackets. In the working-age groups, there are variations, with some age groups having more females (25-34), and others having more males (40-49).

## Hypothesis 3

1.  Areas with higher population densities at the subzone level will have a higher incidence of desired lines forming

## Purpose of Dashboard

This dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive overview by looking at the relationship between desire lines and variables like population density, area size and population.

#### Overall Dashboard

The first dashboard showcases our desire lines and population density data across the 6 subzones that we collected desire line data from (Cheng San, Chong Boon, Kebun Bahru, Punngol Town Centre, Townsvile and Waterway East). It also showcases the spread of our data for both population density and desire lines respectively in the form of a box-and-whiskers graph. Selecting the area on either map would allow the user to see the exact values for desire lines and poulation density on the box-and-whiskers graph.

#### Relationship Dashboard

The second dashboard showcases the relationship between our desire lines and 3 different variables - population density, area size and population respectively. Based on the Population Density & Desire Lines chart, although there is a upward trend observed, the p-value of this trend line is at 0.13. This means that the trend is not statically significant, indicating that there is no real relationship between Population Density & Desire Lines.

As such, we would explore with the other variables to see if they have a statically significant relationship with desire lines. Firstly, based on the Area Size & Desire Lines chart, we noticed that there is an upward trend as well. However, plotting the trend line once again gives us a p-value of 0.27 which also implies that this trend is not statically significant, indicating that there is no real relationship between Area Size & Desire Lines.

Lastly, based on the Population & Desire Lines chart, we observe that there is an upward trend as well. However, plotting the trend line this time gives us a significant p-value of only 0.007. This means that, with our alpha at 0.05, this trend is statically significant, indicating that there is a real relationship between Population & Desire Lines.

# Observations:

Before going to AMK, our group assumed that there would be quite a lot of desired paths within the neighborhood as AMK has quite of history. Indeed, it is surprisingly found that there are not much desired paths around the area from our 2 on-the-ground research.

#### [In terms of walkability:]{.underline}

-   Desired paths are commonly found nearby existing traffic light crossroad

    Assumption: Long waiting time for traffic lights reduce the patience of residents to cross safely

-   Jaywalking are common within the neighborhood

    Assumption: The current designed paths are not the most direct path → residents tend to find a shortcut by themselves

### [**In terms of amenities:**]{.underline}

-   Eateries/ Clinics are usually located below the the HDB blocks 

-   Reachable in walking distances within 5-10 minutes 

-   Low variety of amenities within the neighborhood: lack of parks/ recreational facilities
